    <!-- Description, Ingredients and Steps -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof (/dʒəˈlɒf/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice,
    tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its ingredients
    and preparation methods vary across different regions</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups parboiled rice (such as Uncle Ben's®)</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic,
        curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Cook until chicken starts
        sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15
        minutes. Remove from heat.</li>

        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2
        cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but
        not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7
        minutes.</li>

    </ol>

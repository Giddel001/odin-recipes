    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beans and yam pottage, or stew, is a traditional Nigerian dish. I like to call it a feast in one dish, as it is
    delicious and extremely filling. It's also very easy to make. This is my own recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 yam tuber, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups white beans</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crayfish, ground</li>
        <li>2 cubes soy seasoning (I use Knorr brand)</li>
        <li>1 fish, smoked or dried</li>
        <li>pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 kilogram beef, chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup palm oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the beans until they are soft. Pour them out into a colander and drain.</li>

        <li>In a pot, steam the meat and fish with salt, pepper, onions and seasoning cubes for 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Pour 1 cup of water into the pot. Add the ground crayfish and palm oil. Bring to a boil and allow the oil to disperse in
        the boiling mixture completely. Taste for salt.</li>

        <li>Throw in the chopped yam. Add the cooked beans. Cover the pot for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Serve Hot.</li>

    </ol>
